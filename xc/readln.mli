type result = Ok of string list | Error of string | EOF

val read : Unix.file_descr -> result
(** [read] calls [Unix.read] and returns zero or more newline-delimited byte
    strings. This is in contrast to [input_line], which only reads the next
    newline-delimited string. In case input is available but does not constitute
    a complete string, [read] will return an empty list and buffer the read
    input. It will be returned at a subsequent call. *)

val free : Unix.file_descr -> unit
(** [free fd] removes all buffers associated with [fd]. However, it does not
    close the file descriptor. *)
