# Coverage Analysis

This project can be compiled for coverage analysis using [bisect_ppx]. By
default, this is not done. To compile for coverage analysis, do:

    ./configure --enable-coverage
    make

This sets the `BISECT_COVERAGE` make and environment variable, which adds a dependency
on `bisect_ppx` at `make setup.ml` time.
This ensures that a proper dependency gets added to the META file, so that other
projects can successfully link `xenopsd` even if they are themselves not built
with `bisect_ppx`.

To get a non-coverage build simply run a default build:

   ./configure
   make clean && make

## Support Files

See [profiling/coverage.ml](./profiling/coverage.ml) for the run-time
setup of coverage profiling. This code has no effect when not profiling
during execution. Once [bixect_ppx] has better defaults we could get rid
of it.

## Execution and Logging

During program execution, a binary writes coverage data to

    /tmp/bisect-<binary>-*.out

This can be overridden by setting the `BISECT_FILE` environment
variable, which is otherwise set at startup using the code in
`profiling/coverage.ml`;

## Analysis

See the [bisect_ppx] documentation for details but try from the
top-level directory:

    bisect-ppx-report -I _build -html coverage /tmp/bisect-*.out

This creates an HTML document in [coverage/](./coverage].
