type platformdata = (string * string) list

val is_valid : key:string -> platformdata:platformdata -> bool
(** [is_valid key platformdata] returns true if: 1. The key is _not_ in
    platformdata (absence of key is valid) or 2. The key is in platformdata,
    associated with a booleanish value *)

val is_true : key:string -> platformdata:platformdata -> default:bool -> bool
(** [is_true key platformdata default] returns true, if the platformdata
    contains a value for key that is "true" or "1". It returns false, if a value
    "0" or "false" exists. If the key doesn't exist or contains none of the
    values above, [default] is returned. *)
